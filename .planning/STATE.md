# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-02 for v2.2 milestone)

**Core value:** Multiple entities can discover and exchange authorization information without exposing details, with every access decision computed live from attributes and fully explainable/auditable — federated ABAC model proven through v2.1.
**Current focus:** v2.2 Phase 9 — Digital Resource Model & Policy Engine (ready to plan)

## Current Position

Phase: 9 of 11 (Digital Resource Model & Policy Engine)
Plan: — (not yet planned)
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-06-02 — Roadmap created for v2.2 Phases 9–11

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 4 (from Phase 8)
- Average duration: ~8 min
- Total execution time: ~16 min (Phase 8)

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 08 | 2 | ~16 min | ~8 min |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

v2.2 key decisions (from research/ARCHITECTURE.md and PITFALLS.md):

- Application has NO `classification` field — inherited from Platform at resolution time (anti-pattern 2)
- Zone-prerequisite is advisory (non-blocking `zoneAdvisory` field, never affects `allow`) — see Pitfall 2
- Cross-tier inheritance is explicitly blocked — Gate 2 checks exact-resource grant, Gate 3 checks parent tier independently — see Pitfall 1
- WorldState extension uses `digitalResources: DigitalResourceWorld` sub-object, not flat fields — see Pitfall 4
- Digital-resource types appended to existing `lib/model.ts` (not a new file) to avoid circular imports with zone-prereq wiring
- `TOGGLE_RESOURCE_GRANT` uses `resourceGrantId` field (not `grantId`) to avoid collision with physical `TOGGLE_GRANT`

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
