# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-02 for v2.2 milestone)

**Core value:** Multiple entities can discover and exchange authorization information without exposing details, with every access decision computed live from attributes and fully explainable/auditable — federated ABAC model proven through v2.1.
**Current focus:** Phase 11 — digital-resource-backend (next to plan). Original Phase 11 was expanded to a full-stack vertical and split: Phase 11 = backend + Rust resolver port + read/issue API; Phase 12 = demo UI/loader/tab (depends on 11).

## Current Position

Phase: 10 (mock-dataset-worldstate) — COMPLETE & VERIFIED
Plan: 2 of 2
Status: Verified — 5/5 success criteria, 193 tests pass (10-UAT.md)
Last activity: 2026-06-18 -- Phase 10 verified; next: /gsd-plan-phase 11

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 4 (from Phase 8)
- Average duration: ~8 min
- Total execution time: ~16 min (Phase 8)

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 08 | 2 | ~16 min | ~8 min |

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 09 P01 | 6 min | 2 tasks | 1 files |
| Phase 09 P02 | 5 min | 2 tasks | 1 files |
| Phase 09 P03 | 3 min | 2 tasks | 1 files |
| Phase 09 P04 | 6 min | 2 tasks | 2 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

v2.2 key decisions (from research/ARCHITECTURE.md and PITFALLS.md):

- Application has NO `classification` field — inherited from Platform at resolution time (anti-pattern 2)
- Zone-prerequisite is advisory (non-blocking `zoneAdvisory` field, never affects `allow`) — see Pitfall 2
- Cross-tier inheritance is explicitly blocked — Gate 2 checks exact-resource grant, Gate 3 checks parent tier independently — see Pitfall 1
- WorldState extension uses `digitalResources: DigitalResourceWorld` sub-object, not flat fields — see Pitfall 4
- Digital-resource types appended to existing `lib/model.ts` (not a new file) to avoid circular imports with zone-prereq wiring
- `TOGGLE_RESOURCE_GRANT` uses `resourceGrantId` field (not `grantId`) to avoid collision with physical `TOGGLE_GRANT`
- [Phase ?]: Phase 9: GateDescriptor is a parameterized open-edge union (D-01/D-02); zone_prereq_id declared policy-level (A1); CLEARANCE_FLOOR deferred to comment-only (A2); effectiveClassification fails closed on missing host Platform (T-09-01) — Locked in 09-CONTEXT decisions; mitigates T-09-01
- [Phase ?]: 09-04 SEED-06: MilNet two-window policy shift across 2026-03-01; subj-1 ALLOW(Feb)/DENY(Apr)
- [Phase ?]: 09-04 SEED-07: separate IntelNet NetworkNode, single non-baseline policy; REQUIRED_ROLE gate asserted present in the trace
- [Phase ?]: 09-04 RESOURCE_DELEGATES omitted (plan-sanctioned): canIssueResourceGrant covered by inline 09-03 fixtures

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None.

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 11 edited: split original Phase 11 (full-stack scope expansion): Phase 11 = digital-resource backend + Rust resolver port + read/issue API; new Phase 12 = demo UI/loader/tab. RSRC-BE-01..05 added; RSRC-UI-01..03 remapped to 12 + UI-04/05/06 added.
- Phase 13 added: Security hardening — server-side RBAC across all backend domains, remove JWT secret hardcoded fallback, tighten CORS. Sourced from `.planning/codebase/CONCERNS.md` after 2026-06-23 codebase remap.
